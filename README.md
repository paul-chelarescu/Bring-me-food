Developers are busy people. We don't have time to wander around for food when we inevitably get hungry, nor do we have the willpower to move our hands any further away from our mice. 

Bring-me-food is an app which solves this problem. Having a Myo on your arm, you need only raise your hand from the mouse to make a smart gesture, and food/drinks will techo-magically appear to you. The organizers get notified on a special website the table number and the preference of the dev (expandable beyond only food/drink), which they can then serve according to their needs. Users only need to tell the app their table number, wear a Myo, and make the gesture whenever the caloric valut starts to empty. A pretty convenient tool to have when you're busy developing the next tech epoch.
