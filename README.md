Developers are busy people. We don't have time to wander around for food when we inevitably get hungry, nor do we have the willpower to move our hands any further away from our mice. 

Bring-me-food is an app which solves this problem. Having a Myo on your arm, you need only raise your hand from the mouse to make a smart gesture, and food/drinks will techo-magically appear to you. The organizers get notified on a special website with the table number and the preference of the developer (food or drink). Users only need to tell the app their table number, wear a Myo, and make the gesture whenever the caloric vault starts to empty. A pretty convenient tool to have when you're busy developing the next big thing.

Start the app by putting in your table's number.

Scan and pick your myo, sync it, and you will be prompted to make a choice.
